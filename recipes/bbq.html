      BBQ skewers require no introduction, being one of the most popular

      what we'll need:
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds spicy Italian sausage, sliced</li>
      <li>1 large red bell pepper, cut into large chunks</li>
      <li>¼ pound jalapeno peppers, cut into large pieces</li>
      <li>1 large red onion, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer</li>
      <li>½ pound sliced provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place sausage, red bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, and red onion in a
        large bowl. Pour in beer. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at
        least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
      <li>
        Alternately thread sausage, red pepper, jalapenos, and onion onto
        skewers. Cook on the prepared grill until sausage is evenly brown and
        vegetables are tender. Melt provolone cheese over the hot ingredients
        during the last few minutes of cooking.
